## Project Steps

This project is broken down into several guided steps, building your AWS security knowledge incrementally.

### Step #0: Before We Start - Project Goal

Understand the objective: Demonstrate how to control access to AWS resources, specifically EC2 instances, using IAM by setting up policies and user groups for different environments (production and development).

### Step #1: Launch EC2 Instances

You'll start by acting as a DevOps engineer at NextWork, tasked with boosting computing power and onboarding an intern.

* **Objective:** Launch two Amazon EC2 instances: one for your `production` environment and one for your `development` environment.
* **Key Actions:**
    * Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
    * Launch the first EC2 instance:
        * Name: `nextwork-prod-<your_name>`
        * Tags: `Key: Env`, `Value: production`
        * Ensure a Free Tier eligible **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** and **Instance Type** are selected.
        * Proceed without a key pair for simplicity in this project (though not recommended for real-world scenarios).
    * Launch the second EC2 instance:
        * Name: `nextwork-dev-<your_name>`
        * Tags: `Key: Env`, `Value: development`
        * Use Free Tier eligible AMI and Instance Type.
    * Verify both instances are created and tagged correctly.
* **Concepts Explained:**
    * **EC2:** A service that provides virtual computers in the cloud.
    * **AMI:** A template containing the operating system and applications to launch an EC2 instance.
    * **Instance Type:** Defines the hardware components (CPU, memory, storage) of your EC2 instance.
    * **Tags:** Labels used for organizing, identifying, and filtering AWS resources, crucial for policy application.
    * **Virtual Computer vs. Server:** Understanding the difference in purpose and use cases.
    * **Key Pair:** Used for secure SSH access to your EC2 instance (outside the scope of this project).

### Step #2: Create an IAM Policy

Now, set up permissions for the new intern, ensuring they only have access to the development EC2 instance.

* **Objective:** Create an IAM policy that grants access specifically to the development EC2 instance.
* **Key Actions:**
    * Navigate to the IAM console and select "Policies."
    * Choose "Create policy" and switch to the "JSON" editor.
    * Paste the provided JSON policy:
        ```json
        {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
            {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": "ec2:*",
              "Resource": "*",
              "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                  "ec2:ResourceTag/Env": "development"
                }
              }
            },
            {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": "ec2:Describe*",
              "Resource": "*"
            },
            {
              "Effect": "Deny",
              "Action": [
                "ec2:DeleteTags",
                "ec2:CreateTags"
              ],
              "Resource": "*"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```
    * Name the policy: `NextWorkDevEnvironmentPolicy`
    * Add a valid description (e.g., "IAM Policy for NextWork's development environment").
* **Concepts Explained:**
    * **IAM:** Central service for managing identities and access.
    * **Policy:** A document that defines permissions, specifying who can do what to which resources under what conditions.
    * **JSON Policy Structure:** Breakdown of `Version`, `Statement`, `Effect` (`Allow`/`Deny`), `Action`, `Resource`, and `Condition` blocks.
        * **`Effect: Allow` + `Action: ec2:*` + `Condition: ec2:ResourceTag/Env: development`:** Allows all EC2 actions on resources tagged with `Env: development`.
        * **`Effect: Allow` + `Action: ec2:Describe*`:** Allows viewing (describing) all EC2 resources.
        * **`Effect: Deny` + `Action: ec2:DeleteTags, ec2:CreateTags`:** Denies the ability to create or delete tags on any EC2 resource, enhancing security.

### Step #3: Create an AWS Account Alias

Simplify the login process for your intern.

* **Objective:** Create a friendly alias for your AWS account login URL.
* **Key Actions:**
    * In the IAM console, go to "Dashboard."
    * Under "Account Alias," choose "Create."
    * Enter a preferred alias: `nextwork-alias-<your_name>`
* **Concepts Explained:**
    * **Account Alias:** A custom, memorable name that replaces your AWS account ID in the login URL, making it easier for users to sign in.

### Step #4: Create IAM Users and User Groups

Set up the intern's login credentials and manage their permissions efficiently.

* **Objective:**
    * Set up a dedicated IAM group for NextWork interns.
    * Set up a dedicated IAM user for your new intern.
* **Key Actions:**
    * In the IAM console, choose "User groups" and "Create group."
    * Name the group: `nextwork-dev-group`
    * Attach the `NextWorkDevEnvironmentPolicy` to this group.
    * Choose "Users" and "Create user."
    * User name: `nextwork-dev-<your_name>`
    * Tick "Provide user access to the AWS Management Console."
    * **Important:** For this project, uncheck "Users must create a new password at next sign-in - Recommended" (in real-world scenarios, always leave this checked).
    * Add the user to the `nextwork-dev-group`.
    * Note down the console sign-in URL, username, and password provided.
* **Concepts Explained:**
    * **IAM User Group:** A collection of IAM users that allows you to manage permissions for multiple users simultaneously by attaching policies to the group.
    * **IAM User:** An entity that represents a person or application that interacts with AWS.

### Step #5: Test Your Intern's Access

Verify that the permissions are set up correctly.

* **Objective:**
    * Log in to AWS using the intern's IAM user.
    * Test the intern's access to your production and development instances.
* **Key Actions:**
    * Open a new incognito/private browser window.
    * Navigate to the Console sign-in URL provided for the IAM user.
    * Log in using the IAM username and password.
    * **Observation:** Note that certain dashboard panels might show "Access denied," demonstrating initial permission limitations.
    * Go to the EC2 console and try to **stop the production instance**: Observe the "not authorized" error banner.
    * Try to **stop the development instance**: Observe the "Success" banner.
* **Learnings:** This step directly demonstrates the effectiveness of the IAM policy in restricting access based on resource tags, proving that the intern user can manage only the development resources.

### ðŸ’Ž Secret Mission: IAM Policy Simulator (Optional)

For an advanced challenge, explore the IAM Policy Simulator.

* **Objective:** Use the IAM Policy Simulator to test user access in a faster, more efficient way without logging in as the user.
* **Key Benefit:** This tool helps you validate policies and troubleshoot permissions before deploying them.

## Cleanup

**It is crucial to delete all resources created in this project to avoid incurring unexpected AWS charges.**

You should delete the following resources:

* EC2 development instance
* EC2 production instance
* IAM user group (`nextwork-dev-group`)
* IAM user (`nextwork-dev-<your_name>`)
* IAM policy (`NextWorkDevEnvironmentPolicy`)
* Account Alias (`nextwork-alias-<your_name>`)
